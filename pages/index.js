        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I consider myself to be a peopleâ€™s person. I enjoy meeting new people,
          and experiencing different cultures and personalities. I have strong
          interpersonal skills and can connect with others easily. I thrive when
          I am presented with challenges, and view them as opportunities to
          learn and grow. I do well in high pressure environments, and am very
          result driven. I also love to help other people overcome their
          challenges in the workplace, and share knowledge with others,
          encouraging growth and unity as a team. I have found that I naturally
          assume a leadership role in a team dynamic, and others often look to
          me for direction. I am a strategic thinker, and enjoy using my
          initiative to find solutions when presented with the unexpected. I
          learn fast, and take pride in the abilty to absorb and retain large
          amounts of information.,
